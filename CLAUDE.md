We have just done a significant upgrade of all frontend dependencies. Dependencies were from 2019 and we upgraded them to the current versions and replaced them where warrented.
The frotnend consists of 2 parts: SSR and client side. Entry points can be seen in package.json. 
Client side works. SSR has issues
